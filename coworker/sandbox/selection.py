"""Which sandbox provider a session gets (design doc, rulings 17, 18, 22 and 29).

- An explicit choice (the environment variable, or `sandbox_provider` in the machine's
  config.toml) is obeyed. If it says `openshell` and OpenShell is not usable, sessions are
  REFUSED: a silent fallback would hide the loss of protection.
- With no choice made: a headless machine (`openworker up`) uses OpenShell when it is
  installed and running, and otherwise runs `direct` with a loud warning. Anything else
  (the desktop app, the terminal app, tests) runs `direct`, as it always has.
