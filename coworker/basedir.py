"""OPENWORKER_BASE_DIR — one directory the box never looks beyond.

Owner ruling 2026-09-02 (spec §Fly sandboxes, "Base directory"): when the
variable is set, the state dir, every scratch workspace, and every folder a
user adds — typed remote paths, save-as-project targets, extra roots — must
resolve UNDER it; anything outside is refused with a plain error. On a
managed sandbox it is the volume mount (/data). On a machine the user
brought it is optional; unset means today's behaviour, no restriction.

This is the path discipline. The tool-level sandbox that later makes
"nothing beyond base" mechanical (sandbox-refactor-design.md) then changes a
mechanism, not what users see.
